To reduce the time required for cleaning it is preferred that a complete set of tubes be removed together. Thus this design will always have two flow resistors of equal flow that are installed in parallel with only one active at a time. The plant should have a third flow resistor on hand as a spare that can be clean and ready to replace a defective unit at any time.\r\n",
