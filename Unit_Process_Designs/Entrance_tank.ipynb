Perhaps inject the water deeper into the entrance tank so that turbulent eddies are somewhat dissipated by the time they get to the water surface. Or direct the water against the wall of the tank? Perhaps  2\" diameter diffusers (so that clogging isn't a problem) in the vertical entrance pipe with the diffusers pointing upstream toward the end wall of the entrance tank? \n",
        "1.   Plate settlers don't work because the velocities are too high and flow isn't distributed at all unformly through the plates. Recommend either improving flow distribution (see 4520 capstone design project) or reverting to a simple horizontal flow tank to capture grit. The simple horizontal sed tank should be explored as the simplest option.\n",
        "1.   Velocity through the bar screen is too high. Increase the area for the bar screen and include a minimum of 2 bar screens and 3 tracks for inserting the screens so that one can be removed and cleaned and replaced. Screen can be angled to enable it to have more surface area.\n",
        "1.   Velocity of approach for the LFOM is too high causing wave action. See if we can predict the wave action that is observed at Gracias. The waves are simple a conversion of kinetic energy into potential energy, $v=\\sqrt{2gh}$. \n",
