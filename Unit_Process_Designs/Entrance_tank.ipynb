For comparison, the length of one treatment train at Gracias (sed tanks + flocculators) is approxiamtely 15 m, and the width of one treatment train is about 7 m. Therefore, trying to capture such small particles takes up a considerable amount of space, and may drive up materials and construction costs. Additionally, an entrance tank of that size my block plant operator access to important parts of the plant, such as the first four baffles in the flocculator, where plant operators like to observe flocs.

A piece of grit this large probably would not even make it into the plant, and would certainly be caught by the trash racks. Perhaps the equations selected to model the bottom shear in the inlet channel are not applicable to this situation, or the wrong Reynolds number was selected. It is also really hard to read the recast Shields diagram without gridlines - a small amount of reading error could lead to an order of magnitude difference in particle diameter. The initial assumption of this calculation should be checked, and a different method for approximating the shear stress on the bottom of the inlet channel could be considered. \n",

        "To troubleshoot this approach, I first tried calculating the Reynold's number for the channel directly instead of assuming that it is 500,000. I used the total channel length as the important length, because it would lead to the most conservative measure of shear stress (and less shear means that it is more difficult to scour particles). This led to a new Reynolds number of 25,620,000 (This number is really high, I'm not sure if it is reasonable for the open channel flow in this application) and a shear velocity of 6.707 cm/s. These numbers produce an approximate critical particle size of 7.5 mm, and an entrance tank length of 6.5 cm. This is still a very large particle size. \n",

Depending on the flow rate and the need for grit removal, the entrance tank design will range from 1) an entrance tank in-line with the flocculator and with the same width as the flocculator, to 2) an entrance tank the entire length of the flocculator channel and the same width as the floccutor, and 3) to an even wider entrance tank.\n",

        "The trash rack and plate settlers in the entrance tank at Gracias have been unsuccessful at capturing grit and preventing it from traveling to the rest of the plant. This grit causes maintenance issues by settling in the flocculator and the channel leading to the sedimentation tanks. To solve this problem, the plate settlers could be replaced with a more traditional horizontal settling basin. A series of 4-sided hoppers fitted with a drainpipe would make it easy to remove grit from the bottom of the chamber via gravity. However, Kawamura advises against the use of square tanks, due to their poor flow patterns:\n",

        "> âThe square tank is satisfactory for the purpose of wastewater treatment but does not perform well as a water treatment grit chamber. The main problem with the detritus [square] tank is a function of its physical characteristics. The short tank length and the uneven inflow to the tank cause severe flow short-circuiting. â¦ To provide good flow characteristics for grit settling, the chamber should be rectangular with a contracted inlet (pg. 414).â \n",

According to Kawamura, sand and silt smaller than 0.1 mm do not pose a significant risk to downstream processes (pg. 416). For context, a single treatment train (excluding the filters) at Gracias has an approximate 15 m x 7 m area. Increasing the area of the entrance tank would drive up construction costs and may block plant operator access to important parts of the plant.

Perhaps inject the water deeper into the entrance tank so that turbulent eddies are somewhat dissipated by the time they get to the water surface. Or direct the water against the wall of the tank? Perhaps  2\" diameter diffusers (so that clogging isn't a problem) in the vertical entrance pipe with the diffusers pointing upstream toward the end wall of the entrance tank? \n",
        "1.   Plate settlers don't work because the velocities are too high and flow isn't distributed at all unformly through the plates. Recommend either improving flow distribution (see 4520 capstone design project) or reverting to a simple horizontal flow tank to capture grit. The simple horizontal sed tank should be explored as the simplest option.\n",
