        "# Entrance Tank: Executive Summary\n",
        "## 29 June 2020 \n",
        "The trash rack and plate settlers in the entrance tank at Gracias have been unsuccessful at capturing grit and preventing it from traveling to the rest of the plant. This grit causes maintenance issues by settling in the flocculator and the channel leading to the sedimentation tanks. To solve this problem, the plate settlers could be replaced with a more traditional horizontal settling basin. A series of 4-sided hoppers fitted with a drainpipe would make it easy to remove grit from the bottom of the chamber via gravity. However, Kawamura advises against the use of square tanks, due to their poor flow patterns:\n",
        "\n",
        "> “The square tank is satisfactory for the purpose of wastewater treatment but does not perform well as a water treatment grit chamber. The main problem with the detritus [square] tank is a function of its physical characteristics. The short tank length and the uneven inflow to the tank cause severe flow short-circuiting. … To provide good flow characteristics for grit settling, the chamber should be rectangular with a contracted inlet (pg. 414).” \n",
        "\n",
        "**To settle particles greater than 0.1 mm in diameter, the entrance tank at Gracias would need to be 11.13 m in length.** This calculation was done under the assumption of a 60 L/s flow rate, and that the entrance tank is the same width as the flocculator.  According to Kawamura, sand and silt smaller than 0.1 mm do not pose a significant risk to downstream processes (pg. 416). For context, a single treatment train (excluding the filters) at Gracias has an approximate 15 m x 7 m area. Increasing the area of the entrance tank would drive up construction costs and may block plant operator access to important parts of the plant. For example, observing the flocs in the first 4 baffles of the flocculator is one of the most reliable indications of plant performance. \n",
        "\n",
        "The required plan-view area of the entrance tank could be reduced by increasing the critical particle size that needs to be captured. Kawamura recommended a 0.1 mm diameter based on pump and piping damage in downstream processes. However, the predominant issue in Gracias, Honduras is grit settling in the flocculator and inlet channel to the sedimentation tanks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The velocities going around the bottom bend of the flocculator are comparatively higher than velocities in the entrance tank. This suggests that particles larger than 0.1 mm could be scoured from the bottom of the flocculator, and that the entrance tank may be designed for a larger critical particle diameter. **The shear on the bottom of the flocculator should be calculated to determine the largest particle that can be scoured.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Wave action and splashing is another issue occuring in the entrance tank at the plant in Gracias, Honduras. The velocity and kinetic energy was calculated at various points within the entrance tank (Table 1): exiting the influent pipe, through the plate settlers, and at the shallow channel leading to the LFOM. \n",
        "\n",
        "*Table 1: The velocity and kinetic energy at various location in the entrance tank*\n",

        "|Location|Velocity (m/s)|Kinetic Energy (cm)|\n",

        "|LFOM Channel|0.1593|0.1294|\n",
        "\n",
        "The velocity exiting the influent pipe is much greater than other areas of the entrance tank. **This suggests that the kinetic energy exiting the influent pipe may be the primary source of wave action.** Various methods should be explored to reduce this kinetic energy. This design may include the following components:\n",
        "- aiming the influent pipe at the end wall of the entrance tank\n",
        "- use 2\" pipes as diffusers\n",
        "- placing obstacles along the side walls of entrance tank\n",
        "- including a diffuser wall (the trash racks may assist with this)\n",
        "- place an endcap on the influent pipe so that water does not flow straight down into the hopper, and cut a vertical slit down the side to act as a diffuser. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Each component should be evaluated on its effectiveness at dissipating kinetic energy and its ease of construction.** \n"

Perhaps inject the water deeper into the entrance tank so that turbulent eddies are somewhat dissipated by the time they get to the water surface. Or direct the water against the wall of the tank? Perhaps  2\" diameter diffusers (so that clogging isn't a problem) in the vertical entrance pipe with the diffusers pointing upstream toward the end wall of the entrance tank? \n",
        "1.   Plate settlers don't work because the velocities are too high and flow isn't distributed at all unformly through the plates. Recommend either improving flow distribution (see 4520 capstone design project) or reverting to a simple horizontal flow tank to capture grit. The simple horizontal sed tank should be explored as the simplest option.\n",
        "1.   Velocity through the bar screen is too high. Increase the area for the bar screen and include a minimum of 2 bar screens and 3 tracks for inserting the screens so that one can be removed and cleaned and replaced. Screen can be angled to enable it to have more surface area.\n",
        "1.   Velocity of approach for the LFOM is too high causing wave action. See if we can predict the wave action that is observed at Gracias. The waves are simple a conversion of kinetic energy into potential energy, $v=\\sqrt{2gh}$. \n",

Take the velocity coming out of influent pipe, and find the velocity flowing uniformly between the plates. There is very little headloss between the plates, so it's difficult to get an even distribution of flow\n",
