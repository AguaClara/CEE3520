        "\n",
        "The trash rack and plate settlers in the entrance tank at Gracias have been unsuccessful at capturing grit and preventing it from traveling to the rest of the plant. This grit causes maintenance issues by settling in the flocculator and the channel leading to the sedimentation tanks. To solve this problem, the plate settlers could be replaced with a more traditional horizontal settling basin.\n",
        "\n",
        "The required plan-view area of a horizontal settling basin is determined by the terminal velocity of the smallest particle it is designed to remove. Kawamura suggests that sand and silt smaller than 0.1 mm do not pose a significat risk to downstream pumps and processes (pg. 416). **However, to settle particles larger than 0.1 mm in diameter, the entrance tank would need to be 11.13 m in length.** This calculation was done under the assumption of a 60 L/s flow rate, and that the entrance tank is the same width as the flocculator. For comparison, a single treatment train at the Gracias plant (excluding the filters) covers an approximate 15 m x 7 m area. Increasing the area of the entrance tank would drive up construction costs and may block plant operator access to important parts of the plant. \n",
        "\n",
        "The required plan-view area of the entrance tank could be reduced by increasing the critical particle size that it is designed to capture. Any particles that are not captured in the entrance tank must be scoured in the flocculator and the inlet channel of the sedimentation tanks, otherwise they will cause maintenance issues. Calculations should focus on the inlet channel of the sedimentation tanks since it has lower velocities and less shear than the flocculator. \n",
        "\n",
        "Two approaches were taken to calculate the smallest particle that needs to be captured by the entrance tank. The first approach approximates the scouring velocity in the inlet channel with the following equation: $$V_{min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{\\sqrt{Re_x}}{0.332}\\frac{\\rho_{p} - \\rho_{H20}}{\\rho_{H20}}\\ g\\ d_p\\ tan\\theta}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The second approach approximates the shear on the bottom of the inlet channel and uses a modified Shields diagram to determine the corresponding critical particle diameter. **Both approaches produced a critical particle diameter (2.373 mm and 7.5 mm respectively) that is larger than the typical size of sand. These results are not physically reasonable, and do not match observations made by plant operators in Gracias.** The key assumptions made in each approach should be re-examined or a new model should be developed. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Entrance Tank Kinetic Energy**\n",
        "\n",
        "Wave action and splashing is another issue occuring in the entrance tank at the plant in Gracias, Honduras. The velocity and kinetic energy was calculated at various points within the entrance tank (Table 1): exiting the influent pipe, through the plate settlers, and at the shallow channel leading to the LFOM. \n",

        "\n",
        "The velocity exiting the influent pipe is much greater than other areas of the entrance tank. **This suggests that the kinetic energy exiting the influent pipe may be the primary source of wave action.** Various methods should be explored to reduce this kinetic energy. This design may include the following components:\n",
        "- aiming the influent pipe at the end wall of the entrance tank\n",
        "- use 2\" pipes as diffusers\n",
        "- placing obstacles along the side walls of entrance tank\n",
        "- including a diffuser wall (the trash racks may assist with this)\n",
        "- place an endcap on the influent pipe so that water does not flow straight down into the hopper, and cut a vertical slit down the side to act as a diffuser. \n",
        "\n",
        "Each component should be evaluated on its effectiveness at dissipating kinetic energy and its ease of construction.\n",

The Reynolds number is well within the laminar regime so using Stokes' law was an appropriate decision. The entrance tank requires a length of 11.13 meters. For comparison, the length of one treatment train at Gracias (sed tanks + flocculators) is approxiamtely 15 m, and the width of one treatment train is about 7 m. Therefore, trying to capture such small particles takes up a considerable amount of space, and may drive up materials and construction costs. Additionally, an entrance tank of that size my block plant operator access to important parts of the plant, such as the first four baffles in the flocculator, where plant operators like to observe flocs.

A piece of grit this large probably would not even make it into the plant, and would certainly be caught by the trash racks. Perhaps the equations selected to model the bottom shear in the inlet channel are not applicable to this situation, or the wrong Reynolds number was selected. It is also really hard to read the recast Shields diagram without gridlines - a small amount of reading error could lead to an order of magnitude difference in particle diameter. The initial assumption of this calculation should be checked, and a different method for approximating the shear stress on the bottom of the inlet channel could be considered. \n",

        "To troubleshoot this approach, I first tried calculating the Reynold's number for the channel directly instead of assuming that it is 500,000. I used the total channel length as the important length, because it would lead to the most conservative measure of shear stress (and less shear means that it is more difficult to scour particles). This led to a new Reynolds number of 25,620,000 (This number is really high, I'm not sure if it is reasonable for the open channel flow in this application) and a shear velocity of 6.707 cm/s. These numbers produce an approximate critical particle size of 7.5 mm, and an entrance tank length of 6.5 cm. This is still a very large particle size. \n",

        "The trash rack and plate settlers in the entrance tank at Gracias have been unsuccessful at capturing grit and preventing it from traveling to the rest of the plant. This grit causes maintenance issues by settling in the flocculator and the channel leading to the sedimentation tanks. To solve this problem, the plate settlers could be replaced with a more traditional horizontal settling basin. A series of 4-sided hoppers fitted with a drainpipe would make it easy to remove grit from the bottom of the chamber via gravity. However, Kawamura advises against the use of square tanks, due to their poor flow patterns:\n",
        "\n",
        "> “The square tank is satisfactory for the purpose of wastewater treatment but does not perform well as a water treatment grit chamber. The main problem with the detritus [square] tank is a function of its physical characteristics. The short tank length and the uneven inflow to the tank cause severe flow short-circuiting. … To provide good flow characteristics for grit settling, the chamber should be rectangular with a contracted inlet (pg. 414).” \n",
        "\n",
        "**To settle particles greater than 0.1 mm in diameter, the entrance tank at Gracias would need to be 11.13 m in length.** This calculation was done under the assumption of a 60 L/s flow rate, and that the entrance tank is the same width as the flocculator.  According to Kawamura, sand and silt smaller than 0.1 mm do not pose a significant risk to downstream processes (pg. 416). For context, a single treatment train (excluding the filters) at Gracias has an approximate 15 m x 7 m area. Increasing the area of the entrance tank would drive up construction costs and may block plant operator access to important parts of the plant. For example, observing the flocs in the first 4 baffles of the flocculator is one of the most reliable indications of plant performance. \n",
        "\n",
        "The required plan-view area of the entrance tank could be reduced by increasing the critical particle size that needs to be captured. Kawamura recommended a 0.1 mm diameter based on pump and piping damage in downstream processes. However, the predominant issue in Gracias, Honduras is grit settling in the flocculator and inlet channel to the sedimentation tanks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The velocities going around the bottom bend of the flocculator are comparatively higher than velocities in the entrance tank. This suggests that particles larger than 0.1 mm could be scoured from the bottom of the flocculator, and that the entrance tank may be designed for a larger critical particle diameter. **The shear on the bottom of the flocculator should be calculated to determine the largest particle that can be scoured.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Wave action and splashing is another issue occuring in the entrance tank at the plant in Gracias, Honduras. The velocity and kinetic energy was calculated at various points within the entrance tank (Table 1): exiting the influent pipe, through the plate settlers, and at the shallow channel leading to the LFOM. \n",

        "The velocity exiting the influent pipe is much greater than other areas of the entrance tank. **This suggests that the kinetic energy exiting the influent pipe may be the primary source of wave action.** Various methods should be explored to reduce this kinetic energy. This design may include the following components:\n",

Perhaps  2\" diameter diffusers (so that clogging isn't a problem) in the vertical entrance pipe with the diffusers pointing upstream toward the end wall of the entrance tank? \n",
        "1.   Plate settlers don't work because the velocities are too high and flow isn't distributed at all unformly through the plates. Recommend either improving flow distribution (see 4520 capstone design project) or reverting to a simple horizontal flow tank to capture grit. The simple horizontal sed tank should be explored as the simplest option.\n",
        "1.   Velocity through the bar screen is too high. Increase the area for the bar screen and include a minimum of 2 bar screens and 3 tracks for inserting the screens so that one can be removed and cleaned and replaced. Screen can be angled to enable it to have more surface area.\n",
        "1.   Velocity of approach for the LFOM is too high causing wave action. See if we can predict the wave action that is observed at Gracias. The waves are simple a conversion of kinetic energy into potential energy, $v=\\sqrt{2gh}$. \n",
