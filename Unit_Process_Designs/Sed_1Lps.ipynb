        "## Sedimentation Tank Design\n",
        " This is a typical masonry sedimentation tank, but with a few key differences:\n",
        "1. To eliminate the \"lost triangle\" under the last plate settler and keep the average velocity through the plate settlers closer to the upflow velocity, an inner wall will be built within the sedimentation tank at the location of the bottom of the last plate settler. This will direct flow up at a higher rate and will serve as the weir for the floc hopper, with the floc hopper occupying the space between the inner wall (weir) and the outer wall. Originally, a 60Â° sloped wall was proposed, but Santiago at APP thought this would be less practical.\n",
        "2. Having one sedimentation tank removes the necessity of the four-channel system. In its place, there will be an influent pipe from the pipe flocculator to the inlet manifold and a single pipe from outlet manifold to disinfection.\n",
        "3. To make it possible to drain poorly flocculated water before it reaches the sedimentation tank, it is important to have a tee with a ball valve on the inlet pipe.\n",
        "4. An upflow velocity of 0.85 mm/s (as opposed to the standard 1 mm/s) was selected as a conservative design in the absence of knowledge of the composition of the raw water. High organic content water could have low density flocs that will have a lower settling velocity that requires a floc blanket with a correspondingly lower upflow velocity.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Questions:**\n",
        "- How is the sed tank water level controlled in the plantitas (i.e., without the control weir)?\n",
        "- How should the drain for the floc hopper be sized?\n",
        "\n",
        "### General Parameters\n",
        "Primarily using typical AguaClara conventions, as noted in the code. The upflow velocity is lower to account for the likely presence of natural organic matter in flocs.\n",
        "\n",
