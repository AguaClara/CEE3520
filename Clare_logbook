## June 13th
Short term goals:
- change current DC's to versions to go in the textbook + edits for clarity
- separate conceptual questions from the designs to include in future DC work
- fix the solutions so that images appear correctly in standalone version of the files
Looking ahead:
- think about which concepts need to be included in the conceptual questions and find ways to ask those questions!
Things I'm finding that will need definitely more work:
- alerts about updates to packages. Probably not necessary anymore assuming the package isn't being wildly changed during the semester again
  - **Juan says:** Ask Ethan!
- some variable errors that can probably be fixed (maybe already have in aide_design code) (such as diam_fractal + the warning with it in the floc model DC)

-trouble with file naming and locations of pictures. but now I can push things into the repository so that's useful.
  - **Juan says:** The best way to display an image is to save it somewhere on github and then go to the place where it is saved and right click on it, choosing "copy image location" then paste that into the html code for displaying an image. See a textbook file for reference (if this is the question you are asking)
- **Juan says:** Make this file a markdown file so it can display correctly in github! You can just add a '.md' to the file name.
