## June 13th 
Short term goals: 
- change current DC's to versions to go in the textbook + edits for clarity
- separate conceptual questions from the designs to include in future DC work
- fix the solutions so that images appear correctly in standalone version of the files
Looking ahead: 
- think about which concepts need to be included in the conceptual questions and find ways to ask those questions!
