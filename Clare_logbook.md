## June 13th
Short term goals:
- change current DC's to versions to go in the textbook + edits for clarity
- separate conceptual questions from the designs to include in future DC work
- fix the solutions so that images appear correctly in standalone version of the files
Looking ahead:
- think about which concepts need to be included in the conceptual questions and find ways to ask those questions!
Things I'm finding that will need definitely more work:
- alerts about updates to packages. Probably not necessary anymore assuming the package isn't being wildly changed during the semester again
  - **Juan says:** Ask Ethan!
- some variable errors that can probably be fixed (maybe already have in aide_design code) (such as diam_fractal + the warning with it in the floc model DC)

## June 15th
-trouble with file naming and locations of pictures. but now I can push things into the repository so that's useful.
  - **Juan says:** The best way to display an image is to save it somewhere on github and then go to the place where it is saved and right click on it, choosing "copy image location" then paste that into the html code for displaying an image. See a textbook file for reference (if this is the question you are asking)
- **Juan says:** Make this file a markdown file so it can display correctly in github! You can just add a '.md' to the file name.

- organization of example designs within framework of textbook chapters:  
 
 |textbook chapter| DC's already existing with these topics |
 |------|-------|
 |Energy Diss + Vel Grad|  ??? |
 |Filtration|  DC Filtration |
 |Flocculation| Hydraulic floc, Mech + floc model|
 |Flow control and meas| flow control + meas|
 |Fluids review| ??? | 
 |Rapid mix| rapid mix (focus on convential systems + power)|
 |sedimentation|sedimentation | 
 
 Topics included in each DC:
 |DC|topics|
 |-----|------|
 |Filtration| characterization of fluids, fluidization vel,residence time, total waste and loss from backwash, mass of solids removed, constriction theory|
 |flow control + meas|v+h orifices (w/ expl),function for LFOM based on v+h or eqns,laminar flow controller (stock, tube diam + num, small headloss)|
 |Hydraulic Floc|vert flow desgin, G as f(T), floc'r vol/len/width/num chan/spacing/dist betw expan/res time, if G param changes what happens|
 |Mech floc + floc model|conventail des param (time in floc'r),pwr reqs,max EDR,energy req,cost,fractal floc model, term vel or flocs, inner viscous length scale, time scale, coagulent distribution|
 |Python|python skills|
 |Rapid mix| Temperature effects, energy use, and operating costs, energy dissipation of jet|
 |Sedimentation|Diffuser calcs,  sources of headloss, plate settlers, manifold+launder calcs, (this does not include everything!)|
 
 
 **idea** 
 somehow use half the design challenge as example with sample code, have them complete it, and then ask to change parameters and explain why changes were obsvered. 
 - this will allow some of the design to still happen, but less code intensive
 - and will incorporate the concpetual questions in (as I wonder if there are really enough of those to merit full outside of class work)
