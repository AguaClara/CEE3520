# Textbook Structure
This is the first version attempted of an AguaClara textbook. The current proposed structure is as follows:

The primary division of topics will be in chapters. Each chapter will cover a unit process, like "Flow Control and Measurement" or "Sedimentation."

Each chapter (with a few exceptions), will have the following sections:
- Introduction
- Design
- Derivations
- Uncertainties
- Examples

## Introduction

## Design
This section will contain detailed explanations and all the equations required to understand and design an AguaClara unit process.

## Derivations
Many of the equations that show up in the `Design` portion have lengthy derivations that have been done by AguaClara in the past. The step-by-step derivations of these equations will be found in these sheets. Equations in the `Design` that require substantial derivations will be noted as such in the text.

## Uncertainties
The physics of water treatment has not been figured out, not by AguaClara nor by anyone. Therefore, many of the numbers that AguaClara uses as its basis for design do not have ironclad physical reasons and are usually empirically based. Whenever an uncertain parameter, value, or concept is being discussed, it will show up in <font color="red">red font</font>. Then, the uncertainty will be additionally discussed in this section.

## Examples
This section will contain example problems. A big portion of these example problems will be design challenges that were used in previous years, before this textbook was made available.
