# Textbook Structure
This is the first version attempted of an AguaClara textbook. The current proposed structure is as follows:

Each chapter will cover a unit process, like "Flow Control and Measurement" or "Sedimentation."

Each chapter (with a few exceptions), will have the following sections:
- Introduction
- Design
- Derivations
- Uncertainties
- Examples

## Introduction
The introduction contains two components:
- Introduces and explains concepts relevant to the physics and design of the unit process
- Covers briefly the design of conventional water treatment plants and how they solve the problems associated with the unit process.  

## Design
Contains the details of an AguaClara design for the unit process. Goes over logic and explains thoroughly why design decisions are made.

## Derivations
Many of the equations that show up in the `Introduction` and `Design` sections have lengthy derivations that have been done by AguaClara in the past. The step-by-step derivations of these equations will be found in this section. Equations that require derivations will be noted as such in the text and linked to their derivations.

## Uncertainties
The physics of water treatment has not been figured out, not by AguaClara nor by anyone. Therefore, many of the numbers that AguaClara uses as its basis for design do not have ironclad physical reasons and are usually empirically based. Whenever an uncertain parameter, value, or concept is being discussed, it will show up in <font color="red">red font</font>. This parameter/value/concept's uncertainty will be additionally discussed in this section.

## Examples
This section will contain example problems. A big portion of these example problems will be design challenges that were used in previous years, before this textbook was made available.
