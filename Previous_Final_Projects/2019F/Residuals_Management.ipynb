        "\n",
        "Current protocol for managing residual waste in AguaClara plants consists of piping it away from the plant and releasing it directly to the environment. As Aguaclara plants increase in size and flow rate, alternative residual management solutions are sought to reduce cost and amount of water wasted. A lagoon system is an effective method to recycle wasted water back to the plant, and to dry and dispose of settled sludge. Such a process would require separate lagoons to settle backwash water and to dry sludge. Preliminary calculations were modeled after a 120 L/s plant in Gracias, Honduras. The backwash lagoon would need to hold around 780 $m^3$ of water and would require a velocity of 0.0180 mm/s. One model for the sludge lagoon requires an area between 290 and 600 m^2, depending on whether the climate is 'wet' or 'dry'. This corresponds to a velocity of 0.1405 mm/s. This area is highly variable, because it depends on the seasonal dry and wet period throughout the year. "

        "## Introduction\n",
        "Residual waste from AguaClara plants consists of backwash water used to clean filters, sludge removed from the sedimentation basin, and wasted water during treatment failures. These materials by themselves do not present a threat to the environment, since they are primarily composed of clay, dirt, organic matter, and some coagulant. This waste is currently combined in a pipe, carried away from the plant, and released directly into the environment. With past AguaClara plants serving relatively small populations, this method of handling residuals has not provided an issue financially or environmentally. However, problems are arising as AguaClara plants continue to increase in size. The largest AguaClara plant to date was inaugurated on November 8, 2019 in the town of Gracias, Honduras. It serves a population of 20,000 people at a flow rate of 120 L/s. The town paid 1.7 million Lempiras (about 70,000 usd) just to build a residuals pipeline which is about 7% of the total plant cost. This cost could be reduced by designing on onsite residuals management system. Additionally, incorporating a recycle stream would reduce the amount of water wasted unnecessarily by AguaClara plants. \n"

        "A complicating factor in residual management design is the fact that residual wastes vary widely in turbidity and flow rate. Settled sludge from the floc hopper constitutes a very small percentage of the total residual waste flow, and is composed of highly concentrated flocs. In contrast, the majority of residual wastes come from spent filter backwash water, which has a very low turbidity compared to the sludge. This variability suggests that backwash water and wasted sludge should be treated separately and with different specifications. "

An additional electrical pump would need to be installed to recycle the water back up to the top of the original water treatment plant. This method would easily meet any and all of the EPA regulations and provide even cleaner water to rerun through the plant. However, building a miniature plant is more costly, presents fabrication challenges, requires regular monitoring, and would still produce residual wastes of its own. Furthermore, it does not solve the problem of getting rid of sludge and is more of a redundant process where the water just gets treated over again. There is an even cheaper alternative which is building a set of sludge lagoons and a set of backwash lagoons. A new AguaClara plant would be designed to keep backwash water and sludge separate so that they could enter their respective lagoon without mixing. This separation is ideal due to the large differences in turbidity and volume of the two wastes. Existing AguaClara plants could separate backwash water and sludge by laying a row of bricks in the residuals channel. A minimum of two sludge lagoons are needed so that one can fill up while the other is dried and emptied. Two backwash lagoons are also needed to handle variable flow. This method is much more cost-effective compared to building a miniature plant."

        "\n",
        "A lagoon consists of a large pit dug into the ground, lined with either concrete, clay or a synthetic liner [(*Technology*, 2001)](https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/cafo_cost_method_p3.pdf). The purpose of a lagoon can be either to settle out particles from water or to evaporate excess water from sludge, depending on the volume and turbidity of the residual. For a settling lagoon, water enters near the bottom/middle of the lagoon, and clarified water exits near the top to be recycled. Lagoons often contain emergency drain lines to handle flood risks, and are surrounded by a mound of excavated land called the embankment. For a sludge lagoon, particles build up cake-like layers as water evaporates. When the layers fill the lagoon, the sediment is dug out and disposed of manually or with heavy machinery such as a backhoe. Sludge lagoons are typically designed so that it will have to be dug out every 3-4 months once it reaches the freeboard height (\"4.2 Sludge\", pg. 395). The freeboard height is the distance between the water line and the top of the embankment. Figure 1 below shows an example of a lagoon and the pathway of water flowing in and out. \n",

It also suppresses weed growth and extends the longevity of the lagoon by protecting it from erosion (Kawamura, 2000). \n",
        "The EPA recommends using concrete, because it offers high levels of stability to the sloped sides of the lagoon structure, especially in locations with high sand content[(*Technology*,2001)](https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/cafo_cost_method_p3.pdf). Concrete is also sturdy when dealing with an influx of flow and provides extra strength to prevent any leakage contamination into the soil. Concrete’s main ingredient is portland cement and creating this cement results in high levels of $CO_2$ outputs, resulting in 4-5% of the worlds CO2 output[(*Greenspec*,2019)](http://www.greenspec.co.uk/building-design/environmental-impacts-of-concrete/).\n",
        "Therefore, due to its large carbon footprint, concrete is not an ideal option for an AguaClara lagoon. \n",

        "The USEPA also suggests using synthetic liners such as HDPE and clay liners. Both are  appealing due to their lower cost and lower environmental impact. Clay liner; however, seems to be the more optimal choice. Synthetic liners are only $2.41 \\space \\frac{USD}{ft^2}$whereas clay liners are only $0.39 \\space \\frac{USD}{ft^2}$. Since the contents of backwash water and sludge are rather  non-toxic, concerns about leakage are minimal, and a clay liner will be more than sufficient to provide a boundary between the lagoon contents and the  soil underneath. \n",

        "## Proposed Backwash Management System\n",
        " \n",
        "The EPA does not require, although it does recommend, that the backwash water go through any sort of treatment process in order to be recycled (*Filter Backwash Recycling Rule: Technical*, 2002). Because of this, there is no need for any of the AguaClara plants to send the water from backwashing the filters anywhere else except for back up to the beginning of the plant. However, each filter will get backwashed on average once per day for fifteen minutes. Therefore, there will be times when there is no water from backwash entering the plant and then times when there is a high influx of this water. The backwashing water will be higher in turbidity than the raw water coming into the plant on average. It will be hard for the operators to judge how much coagulant to use and how to treat the water. To solve this we can design to keep the backwashing water in some sort of storage tank. Once the backwashing water is in these tanks we can feed a small steady stream of this backwashing water as to not interrupt the turbidity significantly.\n",
        " \n",
        "Even though there is no need to have any of the particles settle, since AguaClara plants will require a storage of this water, designing this tank to be a lagoon that will settle out at least some of the particles is the most efficient and cost saving option. There will already need to be a tank, which has a cost, and removing any, even if it is a small amount, of particles will also require less treatment of that water since its turbidity will be lowered. Therefore, the backwash water will be fed into a lagoon. The lagoon design will have the same constraints of any of the other lagoons. Thus, its depth will be 3m and the ratio of length to width will be 4:1 and a slope of 3:1 on the sides. This will be the necessary requirments to let any particles settle if they can. Since these particles will already be treated with coagulent from the plant, there is a good chance that they won't dirupt turbidity too much (Kawamura, 2000, pg. 377). \n",
        " \n",
        "The backwash water will need to get back up to the top of the plant since it will be at a lower elevation once it is done backwashing. In this case an electric pump will be needed. Once the filters are backwashed, the water will feed into the lagoon. There will be a pump that can give a constant flow of 3-5 percent of the plant flow. However, this pump will be inefficient, since this flow would be around 1 L/s. For the purposes of an AguaClara plant this is acceptable because any of the water that can be recycled is a positive. \n",
        " \n",
        "The backwashing lagoon will be a set of two, as the EPA recommends. Because we cannot predict the amount of backwashing needed during a large rainstorm event, having a set of two will allow for any major rainfall event to be captured. The lagoons will have drains as well so that if a unprecedented event happens the water can be drained. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Backwash Lagoon Design and Calculations\n",
        "\n",
        "The size of the each lagoon should be big enough to handle a backwash from all filters in a single day. Additionally, when many backwashes are needed in a given day there is likely a large rain event so a safety factor will be included to account for the lagoons filling up that way as well. \n",
        "\n",
        "First, the flow through a filter is calculated using the minimum velocity needed to fluidize the bed and multiplying it by the cross-sectional area of the bed:\n",
        "$$v_{MinFluidization} = \\frac{\\phi_{FiSand}^3 g D_{60}^2}{36 k \\nu \\left( 1 - \\phi_{FiSand} \\right)} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{Sand}}{\\rho_{Water}} - 1 \\right)$$\n",
        "The crosssectional area of the filter will be different based on each plants already calculated needs, so that will just be an input in calculating the flow rate of the backwash.\n",
        "$$Q_{Backwash} = v_{MinFluidization} * A_{x-section\\space bed}$$\n",
        "Then to transform this into a volume of water the flow will be multiplied by the backwashing time. This input is also at the whim of the plant and operators at each plant. So, the time will also be an input:\n",
        "$$V_{Backwash} = Q_{Backwash} * T_{Backwash}$$\n",
        "This is for one bed so this will need to be multiplied by the number of beds in the plant to get a volume of water for one backwash per filter in a day:\n",
        "$$TotalV_{Backwash} = V_{Backwash} * N$$\n",
        "where $N$ = Number Beds\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of the lagoons should be big enough to hold a days worth of backwashing under normal condition. The lagoon will also factor in a safety factor of 20% more backwashing per day, in the case of larger rainfall events:\n",
        "$$V_{Lagoon} = TotalV_{Backwash} * (1.2)$$\n",
        "Depth of 3 meters on each lagoon and a length to width of 4:1:\n",
        "$$SA_{Lagoon} = \\frac{V_{Lagoon}}{3_{meters}}$$\n",
        "$$Length_{Lagoon} = 4 * Width_{Lagoon}$$\n",
        "$$Width_{Lagoon} = (\\frac{SA_{Lagoon}}{4})^{\\frac{1}{2}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "###Constraints to Backwash Lagoon\n",
        "The amount of water in each backwashing event will need to fit in the lagoon. Additionally, the lagoon's geometry will depend on the best fit so that the any particles left in the water will have some sort of chance to settle out.\n",
        "\n",
        "The pump will pump the backwash water up to the inlet of the plant from the lagoons. This pump will be running at all times to ensure a steady flow of 1-3% of the total flow of the plant. Since, normal operating conditions are to backwash for 15 minutes and adding the safety factor becomes 18 minutes, the total flow of backwashing in one day should be 18 out of the total 1440 minutes in a day.

        "For a plant, such as Gracias, that is designed to treat 120 L/s, backwash flow is about 3-5% of the overall plant flow. The calculated sludge lagoon volume is 2,226 m^3 and the calculated backwash lagoon volume is 777.6 m^3. The lagoons need to store sludge and retain backwash water to be recycled back into the plant for a period of 3 ½ months. The cost of building a backwash lagoon is 9,613 USD and annual operating costs are 480.60 USD. The cost of building a sludge lagoon is 13,500 USD and annual operating costs are 674.80 USD. The average cost of building Gracias residuals pipeline is 70,000 USD. Two sets of each lagoon type of lagoon is needed in case one of them overfills. Therefore the total cost of building this residual design will be 46,226 USD. The annual operating costs for 2 sets of sludge and backwash lagoon is 2,310.80 USD. 70,000 USD used for building a Gracias residuals pipeline can cover the costs of building two sets of sludge and backwash lagoons and over 10 years of operating costs. Operator intervention will most likely be needed every 3 ½ months to dig out the dried sludge, which is about only 3-4 times a year. Lagoons are a feasible and cost efficient way of dealing with backwash water rather than using a pipeline or another miniature plant to deal with the problem. Table 3 below summarizes the required sizes and costs of a backwash and sludge lagoon.\n",

        "Three models were developed to calculate the minimum area needed for a sludge lagoon,  based on the 120 L/s  flow rate at the Gracias, Honduras plant. The models produced areas of (1) 16,780 $m^2$,  (2)  271-541 $m^2$, and (3) 43,630 $m^2$, respectively.  For reference, a football field is about 5340 $m^2$. Only the 2nd model produced an area that was conceivable reasonable for an AguaClara plant to implement. On the mountainous terrain of Honduras, it may be difficult to find a large section of land suitable for excavating such large basins, and the shear size predicted   in models 1 and 3 would make the project cost prohibitive. The cost of building two sludge lagoons with base areas of  541 $m^2$ was found to be 27,000 USD with annual operating costs of 674.80 USD each. This installation cost is less than 40% of the total pipeline cost spent at the plant in Gracias, Honduras to remove residual waste. Therefore, lagoons are an extremely cost effective way to handle residual sludge if something can be done to decrease the required land area. The biggest contribution to land area in models 1 and 2 was the low deficit between evaporation rates and precipitation rates estimated for Honduras. Additionally, the precipitation rate for regions of Honduras may have been underestimated, meaning that the actual lagoon area needed is greater than those calculated in this report. An important failure mode for the design of a sludge lagoon occurs when the average precipitation rate in a region is greater than its evaporation rate. This net accumulation of water in the lagoon would preclude sludge drying. One possible way to mitigate the effect of precipitation on sludge drying rates would be to ensure a broad and tall embankment surrounded by sufficient plant coverage to prevent flooding and erosion. Additionally, the sludge lagoon could be fitted with a drainage system that would carry excess water to the backwash lagoon. Doing so would minimize the amount of water that needs to be removed by evaporation. \n"
