        "The CDC is consisted of the linear flow orifice meter (LFOM) and the “Almost Linear” flow controller. The LFOM is a pipe with rows of holes (orifices) on it. As shown in figure 1, there are fewer holes on the top and more holes on the bottom of the pipe. All holes have the same size. Calculations need to be done to determine the number of holes on each row. Water flows down the LFOM in the set up. \n",

        " “Almost linear” flow controller consists of constant head tank (CHT), a float valve and a flexible tube at the bottom of CHT. The float valve is used to keep the solution in CHT at a constant water level. Above the CHT, there is a stock tank that stores chemical solutions. There is a different tube connects the stock tank and the float valve. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Now let’s look at the entire CDC set up. Please refer to the diagram in figure 2. Start at the Constant Head Tank (CHT). We use a tube with large diameter to connect the bottom of  CHT because we want to minimize the head loss. We chose to use three thin, straight tubes instead of one tube because we want to generate major losses instead of minor losses, and this will ensure the Hagen-Poiseuille equation being applicable. In this case, the flow will be directly proportional to the head.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The slider is rested on a lever. LFOM adjusted the water level in the entrance tank, and the leveler connects the water level to the difference in head between the CHT and the end of the dosing tube. This enables CDC to automatically adjust the flow of chemicals based on a change in the plant flow rate and maintain a constant dose in the plant water. At one end of the lever, a float is used to track the water level in the entrance tank. The counterweight on the other side of the lever makes the float *track the water surface*. \n",

        "\n",
        "For this project, we want to design a CDC that allows a larger flow (more than 100 L/s) because now the the plant is aimed to serve a city instead of a small town, and the water flow will be much greater.  This may change the current design significantly because at a certain flow rate we will need to change to a larger float valve.  In addition, we need to keep the flow in the dosing tubes laminar to maintain a linear relationship between headloss and flow.  With a higher flowrate, the velocity and/or the diameter will need to be increased and this will lead to a higher Reynolds number.  This will impact the number of dosing tubes used. The current design uses three dosing tubes based on the minor loss constraints and the required flow rate of the current AguaClara plants.  If we were to change the 3 short tubes into one long one, that would increase the flow and therefore the velocity through the dosing tube.  Since we are trying to keep minor loses minimal to achieve a linear relationship between headloss and flow, increasing the velocity would change the ratio betwee minor losses and major losses as minor losses scale with v^2 and major losses scale with v. \n",

The length of the coagulant tubes is limited by the size of the plant. The actual length of the tubes would be longer than 15.6m because there is currently a bug in the CDC code that fails to check the Reynolds number constraint for laminar flow. In order to meet this constraint, the tubes would have to be even longer to get the desired flow. Since the tubes are already too long, using this method would not be possible for a plant of this size. In addition, the flow would be turbulent which is not desirable for the design because we want to maintain a linear relationship.

        "All the dosing systems compared in the table above are variations on water powered chemical injection devices, and do not require electricity to run. However, they operate with much smaller flowrates than the Aguaclara dosing controller, with the maximum flowrate of 2.78 liters/second handled by the Superdos45 system. In water treatment applications, these dose controllers require a bypass system, where a percentage of the flow is directed into the chemical injection unit. For a 430 L/s plant, this percentage would range from approximately .1-.6% of the plant flow rate. The concentration is diluted from stock concentration when injected into the diverted flow and then mixed back into the rest of the flow downstream to give the desired coagulant or chlorine dosage. Separate dose controllers would be required for chlorine and coagulant. As creating the bypass creates added construction cost and diverting the flow so that the dosage remains proportional to the overall plant flowrate is not a trivial challenge, these systems do not seem like feasible alternatives to Aguaclara’s dose controller. However, if one of the above systems were to be chosen, the MixRite system has the largest dilution range out of all the systems, giving the plant operator’s greatest control over chemical dosing. Another important consideration would be the head loss going through the dose controller, represented in the chart by the pressure loss through their respective systems. The aguaclara system currently operates with about 20 cm of headloss, which corresponds to a pressure loss of 1.9 kPa (calculations below). The alternative systems with pressure loss available require almost 100 times more head to operate. This high energy requirement is not feasible in aguaclara plants."

        "\n",
        "The current CDC design is not feasible for larger plants with larger flows. The number of tubes that the current design proposes for this flow is 41 tube which would be too many for the operator to manage since the tubes will need to be cleaned regularly as they can clog. When we increased the diameter to be larger, the flow through the dosing tubes became turbulent. Since we want the relationship between headloss and flow to be linear, we cannot have turbulent flow through these tubes. Therefore, the current design is not viable for a 430 L/s flow.  \n",
        "\n",
        "We looked into commercially available alternative dosing systems but they all required the addition of a bypass system so that only a portion of the flow goes through the device at a time. Adding in a bypass system would be costly and require changes to the plant infrastructure which is not ideal. Finally, the high energy requirements of these devices make them unattractive for use in AguaClara plants.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on these failures, we have to reconsider various aspects of the current CDC design that would need to be changed for higher flow rates. This includes sizing the float valves for larger flows, changing the dimensions of the CDC tubing, implementing a new geometry for how the coagulant tubes are arranged and changing the size of the float to balance the dosing meter.

        "\n",
        "With a higher flow rate, the headloss through the additional tubing that delivers the chemical to and from the dosing tubes must be kept to less than 1 cm (5% of the 20 cm design headloss through the dosing tubes).  This includes the long straight tube bringing the chemical from the constant head tank to the dosing tubes, the rigid tube bringing the chemical from the dosing tubes to the meter, the flexible tubing attached to the meter that allows the plant operator to move the dosing meter, and the tubing that brings the chemical from the bottom of the drop tube to the LFOM.    \n",
        "\n",
        "The dimensions of L1 and L2, as labeled in the image below, are estimated as 1.5m and 0.5m, although this would change based on where and how the CDC is installed in a particular plant. The straight, larger pipe lenghth is 2*L1, accounting for the piping on both sides of the dosing tubes, and the flexible tubing is 0.5 m long to give enough slack to allow the tubing to move up and down the 0.5 m long dosing meter. Flow through the drop tube is open channel to make sure the height of water in the LFOM does not feed back into the CDC flow so the only other pipe flow is through the one delivering the chemical from the bottom of the drop tube to the LFOM, which is a length of L2.  This design uses the same diameter flexible tubing as the rigid pipe to minimize headloss from an unneccessary flow contraction.  Additionally, all tubing is made out of pvc to ensure chlorine resistance.\n",

        "\n",
        "The fluid makes one 180 degree bend going from the rigid to the flexible tubing, which gives a conservative estimate of the minor loss coefficient of 1.5 ([Engineering Toolbox](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/minor-loss-coefficients-pipes-d_626.html)). The k-values to exit into the drop tube and then enter into the last pipe are both estimated as 1 giving a total minor loss coeficient of 3.5. The minor losses of the fluid entering and exiting the dosing tubes is included in the k-value for the dosing tube design."

Since the smaller PVC tubes are flexible, the voids in between small tubes can be neglected during calculation. The thickness of the selected PVC tube is 1/16 inches. This is one of the thinnest PVC tubes we can find on market that meet the length requirement. Although straws are thinner, we can not find long enough (more than 1 m) straws with thin walls on market. We thus stayed with the 1/8'' inner diameter, 1/4'' outer diameter and 1/16'' thickness PVC pipe. The price of the small tubes is also relatively cheap. For 50 ft of 1/8'' x 1/4'' tubes, the cost is $33.6. The link below shows one possible purchase choice.\n",

        "Since the current CDC design would require 41 dosing tubes for a 430 L/s plant, we determined that a new geometry was required for the dosing tubes for high flow rate plants to prevent an unfeasible amount of connections.  This new geometry would consist of small 1/8th diameter tubes being inserted into a larger diameter tube so that the required major head loss and reynolds number constraints were met inside the small tubes but the only required connections are for the larger tubes that housed them.  We chose the size of the larger tube to give us 3 dosing tube units at 430 L/s so that one tube may be taken offline and cleaned while the others continued to operate.  This new geometry works for flow rates of from 200 L/s up to 2000 L/s, where the number of dosing tube units reaches 13 and again begins to become unreasonable.  For flow rates smaller than 200 L/s, only one dosing tube unit would be needed, and having only one large tube is not a very robust design.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The size of the float becomes unweildly at a lower flowrate than the maximum for the new dosing tube geometry, reaching a radius of 35 cm at 1000 L/s.  This would take up over 50% of the 1 m wide entrance tank.  The size of the float may be reduced by implementing a pully system from the ceiling that exactly counterbalances the weight of the tubing.  Further considerations to minimize float size is recommended."
