Potential Conceptual Design Questions as existed previously in DC's
1. General Flow:  
a.  Why doesn't the flow change much in a plant over a wide range of temperatures even though the viscosities change greatly over  10-30 degree C range?
    - The flow is turbulent so viscosity doesn't matter
2. LFOM Failure:  
a.
  Describe at least two failure modes where the design produces very inaccurate flow measurements.
    - For very high flow rates (100 L/s) that the LFOM doesn't reach the target flow until half of the LFOM is submerged.
    - For very low flow rates (1 L/s) the algorithm overshoots with too many orifices in the bottom row.  

    b.
  Explain why all LFOMs perform poorly when the water depth is in the first row of orifices.
   - The relationship between head and flow is nonlinear for a single row of orifices. Thus it is impossible for the LFOM to be accurate when there is only one row of orifices.  

    c.
  Explain why all of the bottom several rows have the same number of orifices for flows about 30 L/s. (Hint: What constrains the maximum number of orifices that can be in a row?)
    - The number of orifices in a row is limited by the circumference of the LFOM. For high flow rates the ideal number of orifices in the first row exceeds the space and thus the flow target is not met for the first several rows. Each of these rows simply has the maximum number that can fit around the pipe.
3. What control the flow? What measure the flow? How are they related?
